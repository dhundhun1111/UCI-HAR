# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning

This project uses the **UCI HAR Dataset** to classify human activities based on raw inertial sensor data from smartphones. It implements **Deep Learning (CNN, LSTM)** on raw sensor signals and **Machine Learning (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression)** on engineered features extracted using **TSFEL**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

### **1. Data Processing & Exploration**
- Load **raw accelerometer and gyroscope signals** from the UCI HAR Dataset.
- Visualize sample signals and class distributions.
- Normalize raw signals using training set statistics.

### **2. Deep Learning on Raw Data**
- Train **1D CNN** and **LSTM** models directly on raw sensor data.
- Evaluate performance using accuracy and confusion matrices.

### **3. Feature Engineering & Machine Learning**
- Extract features using **TSFEL** (Time Series Feature Extraction Library).
- Handle missing values in extracted features.
- Load original **561 precomputed features** provided by dataset authors.
- Train **Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression** on both feature sets.

### **4. Model Comparison & Analysis**
- Compare **Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning** models.
- Compare **TSFEL-generated features vs. original features**.
- Summarize results using tables and bar plots.
